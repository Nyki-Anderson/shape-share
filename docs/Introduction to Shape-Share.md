## Formatting Conventions in this Tutorial  
  
Before we get started, here are some typographical conventions I will be using throughout the tutorial. Notice that *italics* denote the project file system that you will be implementing on your host computer and **bold** text is a reference to a file within this repository specifically.   
  
| Type of Text  | Corresponding Information                       |  
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |  
| **bold**      | Files Within this Repository                    |  
| *italic*      | Project Filename or Path to File on Host System |  
| `inline code` | Application, Language, or Tool Name             |  
  
```bash  
This is code to run.  
```  
  
> :memo: Note  
> This is a note  
  
> :warning: Warning!  
> This is a warning
