# About Shape-Share
Shape-Share is a simple online image sharing platform where members can upload, react, save, and search for images of shapes. A Shape-Share image can be described by its color/s/ and respective shape/s/ using tags for intuitive searches and increased visibility within the community. Members can subscribe to other members to generate a personal feed based off their interests, as well as define a taste profile to help Shape-Share deliver recommendations. Connect with the community on discussion boards and comment on images to share the love. Organize uploads by album, save others' images as favorites, and/or return to previously viewed images with the history feature. All of these tools are available in the Member Dashboard, providing a unique experience for each member.

With a focus on security, Shape-Share utilizes SSL, data-at-rest encryption, and many other techniques to protect members' personal data. Privacy settings can be adjusted to tailor the degree of "sharing" each member has with the rest of the Shape-Share community. All images are required to be created by the member that uploads them (using Paint, GIMP, etc.) and must be 100% original. Members agree to this when registering for an account. Shape-Share also monitors content for plagiarism, profanity, and general misconduct to keep the community safe and inclusive for all ages.

## A Labor of Love
This personal project started as a way to learn front and backend website development and has evolved into a self-teaching tool I wish to share with the world. I am a student seeking a BS in computer science, so I am in no way an authority on the techniques, programs, or coding logic used herein. Shape-Share is a testament to my personal journey developing my first website from scratch.

This repository will document the entirety of the project from server setup to deployment of the site. Be sure to follow this `README.md` document for full instructions on how to build your very own Shape-Share project and learn along the way.

## TL;DR 
Build your own fully functioning Shape-Share site using the Docker. I recommend doing so in a Visual Studio Code workspace, where the package was developed.
